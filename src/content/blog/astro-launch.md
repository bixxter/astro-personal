## Personal website

I always wanted to have a one. Every time I started building it, I got stuck with the design or the tech stack. Actually, **[my first ever React SPA](`https://bixxter.github.io/louvre/#/`)** application was kind of a personal "network"(oh, God code was such a mess). After so many years, I finally launched it. It's built with Astro and Tailwind CSS.

<br/>

## Astro

Lately, I have been doing `Vue.js` a lot. SPAs are great, however, this time SSR or SSG is a way to go. I have tried `Nuxt.js` before, and it's great. Yet, I wanted to try something new.
So far I'm loving Astro, it's refreshing to try SSGðŸŒ±.

<br/>

## Plans

This is just the beginning, still draft phase. Even markdown rendering is bad, since tailwind base styles applied globally.

<br/>

So far:

- [x] Test deploy and custom domain
- [ ] Separate Layouts
- [ ] Basic SEO (meta tags, sitemap, robots.txt - all in good structure)
- [ ] Build optimization
- [ ] Light/Dark modes (currently supported by system switcher)
- [ ] CMS integration
